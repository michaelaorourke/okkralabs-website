# Okkralabs Website — Master Plan

## Vision
A modern, dark-theme marketing site that establishes Okkralabs as a credible **product engineering partner** for startups and mid-market companies. The site must generate qualified inbound leads (booked calls + contact form submissions) by communicating clarity, senior capability, and long-term partnership value.

## Who We Are
Okkralabs is a product engineering consultancy founded in 2010 and based in the San Francisco Bay Area. We are not a dev shop, staffing firm, or agency. We are a long-term technical partner that helps companies build new digital products and strengthen the ones they already run.

## Who This Is For
- **Primary:** CTOs, VPs of Engineering, Heads of Product, Founders/CEOs
- **Situation:** They need to build something new fast, modernize a legacy platform, or get senior technical leadership without hiring a full team
- **Company size:** Seed through Series C startups, SMBs, mid-market enterprises

## How It Should Feel
Vercel meets Linear meets Stripe. Dark, minimal, high-contrast. The site should feel like it was built by the kind of engineers you'd want to hire. No marketing fluff, no stock photos, no animations for their own sake. Every element should communicate: competent, calm, senior.

## Tagline
**Build new. Improve existing. Ship confidently.**

## Conversion Goals
1. **Primary:** Book a call (Calendly link)
2. **Secondary:** Submit contact form
3. **Tertiary:** Explore services / read case studies

## Key Documents
- **Implementation Plan:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — build sequencing and dependencies
- **Design Guidelines:** `docs/DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` — concrete visual specs and CSS values
- **User Journeys:** `docs/USER_JOURNEYS.md` — persona-based flows through the site
- **Site Structure:** `docs/SITE_STRUCTURE.md` — navigation and page hierarchy
- **Positioning:** `docs/REFERENCE_positioning.md` — messaging framework and copy direction
- **Task List:** `tasks.md` — granular numbered tasks for AI-assisted execution

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS 3
- TypeScript 5 (strict, no `any`)
- Deployed on Vercel (no env vars required for MVP)
- No CMS, no database, no paid dependencies

## What Success Looks Like
A visitor should be able to land on the homepage, understand what Okkralabs does within 5 seconds, feel confident in the team's capability within 30 seconds, and find a clear path to make contact within 60 seconds.
