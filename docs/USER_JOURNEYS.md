## Journey 4: The Quick Scanner (Cold Traffic)
**Persona:** Technical PM who clicked a link from LinkedIn. Has 30 seconds to decide if this is worth their time.

1. Lands on **Homepage**
2. Scans hero: headline + tagline badges ("Senior engineering", "Product-minded delivery")
3. Scrolls once to see **Service Pillars** cards
4. Decides this looks credible → scrolls to **How We Work** for process validation
5. Hits **CTA** at bottom → clicks "Book a call" or "Explore services"
6. If clicks services → scans page, then clicks "Book a call" from that page's CTA

**Key requirement:** The homepage must communicate value without requiring navigation. Hero → Pillars → Process → CTA is the complete pitch in one scroll.
